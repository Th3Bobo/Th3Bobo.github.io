O men of brave hearts, who shun The ruin of combat, But whose lives are faithful unto death, Take this symbol of thy faith and march On!

So much hath been, and so much shall be, But the end of all is Love!

And thus do I, in the stillness of the night, Await that black ship on the sea.

Memento mori

remember that you must die

soul of the great lion

He feeds not alone on women, but is oftentimes joined by others. He is not one of the churchy company who feast on man-meat, but he is as equally at home among flesh-eaters.

Thou also wast condemned from the beginning,

To sin by men's hands and be taken away

from the commands of thy God.

He seeth that all men are fools, but he never judges. He may if he wills, may have all men to be damned.

Delivered unto others, the message that condemns, he leaves not the soul alone.

A soul whose time has come,

Will be disposed of in his sight,

If we could but learn what we have done.

An invisible hand will guide us all our days;

The knowledge that there is a better place than where we lie,

Will always be upon our lips.

If we could but learn that we have sinned

and that it is all a lie;

That death is what we go to, and not the other way

round:

Then shall we die no more, nor shall we seek,

And rest in our coffins, "there is no other way"

Than to live with the Lord, to his feast.

Therefore live, love, live on:

A perfect man hath not yet died,

Nor has the perfect life passed away,

But God grant that we may attain to them.

A soul that dies in its imperfection,

That believes that all is vanity,

That believes that there is nothing that can help,

God grant, that he may cease to exist;

And if he continue, in his present form,

Seek the many and make his peace with the many.

But if we could learn that it is enough,

To love what is evil,

To hate what is good,

To bear the cross,

And to do good;

To search
