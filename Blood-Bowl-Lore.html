<p id="headerLine">Blood Bowl Lore</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">WIP! I was like a kid in a candy store the first time I came across Lore of Nuffle. It is nowadays being hosted at <a href="https://loreofnuffle.talkfantasyfootball.org/"> TalkFantasyFotball.org.</a> I might not achieve the same grandure but hope to give back to the community by imitating that which came before me and cary on where it left off. I pride myself on diligently scour the lore for any tidbit of information. I periodically update my <a href="https://snowwhitehills.blogspot.com/p/sources.html">list</a> of lore sources: books, novels, rule books, games and articles published by Games Workshop.</h4>
