Well, creeping vomit is one of the least frightening things I\'ve ever seen, so when it attacked, as Verena is my witness, I almost died of shock. It shot out a&#8230; an arm? Or something like that, hit my leg and wrapped around it. Al I could feel was the burning! Even through my clothes. Marta swatted at it with her torch.

Although each have their unique traits, they all share a few points in common. For example, all are capable of employing temporary projections called pseudopods formed from their cell walls, and all have a highly developed \'vacuole\' that helps maintain their osmotic pressure. Exactly how this operates is still to be ascertained, but I strongly deny claims that it must be the product of, or influenced by, this so-called aethyr.

quotes[19] = "Pity them? Yes, gentlemen, we must pity them. For many were once Human, born to good citizens of the Empire and brought up as Human until their mutations became apparent. Many, indeed, are tragic in both their origins and their eventual fate. Yet they represent one of the most dangerous and insidious threats to the Empire that we will ever face. It is common practice among the rural areas for peasants who give birth to mutated children to abandon them in the forests, leaving them to be found by their own kind in the hope that this way they will at least have some kind of existence. This attitude is weakness, a pervasive, perfidious weakness that could be the downfall of our great land\; we must deal with any who practice it just as we would deal with a gang of Chaos Marauders come down from the north or a nest of Beastmen themselves, for thus and so are the numbers of the Beastmen replenished. According to my own researches, most adult Beastmen are sterile\; thus many of the outlying Imperial villages must be heavily tainted Chaos, acting as breeding grounds for these abominations. Our pity must not stay our hands as we strike to destroy all Beastmen - indeed, our pity must give us strength in battle against these foul minions of Chaos, for by slaying the swiftly and mercilessly we both protect the Empire and bring an end to their miserable, tormented existence. Likewise, we may pity their Human parents even less\; the parents were knowingly complticit in evil, while Beastmen themselves cannot help their innately Chaotic natune. I hereby call upon all right-thinking witch-finders and knights of the Empire to be extra-vigilant in seeking out and destroying both Beastmen and those who give birth to and shelter them, for without these Chaos-touched Human parents the threat of Beastmen would be very much reduced.";

quotes[22] = "In many respects, the society and hierarchy of Beastmen are almost as sophisticated as those of Humans. Its structure is rigid, so that every member of a tribe knows his or her place, is completely aware of which other Beastfolk are higher and which are lorwer in the hierarchy\; very un-Chaotic, you might think! Yet movement within that hierarchy is always possible. Any member can challenge the leader or any other member at almost any time, whether formally or informally. The only exception is the Ungors and Brays, those Beastmen or other mutants who are not graced with the horns that are the most distinctive feature of this race. No Gor, or horned Beastman, would consent to being ruled by an Ungor or Bray, however skilled or powerful that lesser Beastman might be. In any case, such a situation never occurs in practice\; Ungors and Brays are simply weaker and less physically imposing than Gors. The occasional spirited Ungor who might step out of line is quickly torn to shreds by the Gors of the tribe. Mutants who do not have at least one animalistic feature, even if it is so minor as enlarged, fang - like teeth, are rarely accepted into Beastmen bands even as Ungors, but sometimes form their own tribes, sometimes led by outcast Gors or other powerful Chaos creatures.<br/><br/>Above the ordinary Gors of a beast tribe are the Bestigors, who tend to be larger, stronger, better-equipped, and better-disciplined than most Beastmen. When a group of Beastmen carries out an ambush or other attack, the Bestigors are typically the front-line troops, closely supported by the Gors, with the Ungors harassing the enemy\'s flanks. Some powerful Gors have too much ambition to be willing to serue as a Bestigor, and force their way up the hierarchy still further. At this point my knowledge of the hierarchy falls down somewhat,but these Gor leaders are known variously as Beastlords, Foe-Renders, Gouge-Horns, Wargors, Banebeasts, and Banegors. Even here the hierarchy seems complex\; these different names are not merely local affectations, but precise statements of rank. These various Gor leaders will work together, each with their own smaller warband, banding together under one supreme leader of each horde. Fortunately, such co-operation is relatively rare, and the typical traveller would be most unlucky to be attacked by a Beastman herd that included more than one powerful leader.";

quotes[23] = "First time I served under General Krugmeister, I was barely more than a boy, fourteen years old and with a sword nearly as big as I was. He\'d forgotten more about fighting Beastmen than I\'ve ever learned, but one of the things that stuck in my mind was his tactic of getting their leaders to fight amongst themselves. I saw him use it half-a-dozen times, and it only failed once.<br/><br/>He did the same thing every time, no matter the size of the Beastman gang—even if there were only two or three of them, they\'d always have a hierarchy of some kind. The Beastman leader was always easy to spot, but the real trick was spotting the Pretender, as he called it, the next-most-powerful Beastman, always looking to take down the leader, to pounce on any moment of weakness and tear him apart. If he could communicate with the Pretender, get him riled enough to attack the leader... well, all their discipline was shot to hell, they\'d be too busy watching the two hard cases fight, they were barely capable of defending themselves—not that we ever attacked till both were near-dead anyway.<br/><br/>The day it failed, the General had ordered me and half-a-dozen of the younger, fitter men to give chase to a Beastman band in hopes of finding where they laired, because they were carrying off a score of captives they\'d taken in a skirmish with our foragers. The idea was we\'d pursue at full speed to keep them in sight, while Colonel Schmidt gathered the rest of the army and followed. The General himself came with us, nigh as fast on his feet as the best of us, even with the grey hairs peppering his beard, yes, even more than in my beard now, lad.<br/><br/>We\'d expected to find one of their temporary camps, the sort they use just as a base for raids, then abandon a few weeks later, but the place they carried the foragers to was in the darkest depths of the forest, marked out by one of their great stone monuments. I\'m not one for superstition but you could feel the reek of Chaos coming off that thing. We watched and waited, concealed in the trees. All their attention was on the captives, whom they were dragging towards this heap of wood on a big flat section of ground stained with blood and ashes.<br/><br/>Krugmeister hissed \'Stay put here, whatever happens.\' Then he circled round and stepped into the clearing, bold as a Marienburg merchant collecting on a bad debt. He nodded at the beast leader, a huge thing it was, twice the height of a tall man with horns like sabres, but his eyes were on this misshapen great Beastman with crusted black pincer-tipped tentacles where its arms should be.<br/><br/>\'You going to let him have the glory of sending them to the Dark Gods, when you did all the hard work capturing them?\' he calls. A look passed between the two Chaos-spawned monstrosities, and then they both stared at the stone, stared back at each other with a gaze that said \'We\'ll settle this later.\'<br/><br/>Without a word they turned on the General. Oh, he fought—fought like a maddened badger he did. He had his war-sword out in a blink, sliced deep into the beast leader\'s neck as its first charge shattered his shield. In the hollow we all tensed, frozen in place by the spectacle, the instinct to flee warring with our loyalty to Krugmeister. Before we decided what to do, he\'d spitted the black-pincered beast on his blade, but the leader—ichor still oozing from the gaping wound in its neck—had its arms round him and was biting at his head. Last we saw of him, he was struggling to pull his sword out from black pincer\'s corpse. An instant later he vanished under a mass of roaring Beastmen. We heard a last yell of defiance and pain, carrying over the bellows and grunts of his attackers, a moment before they tore off his arms and head and hurled them into the air.";

quotes[25] = "The Spawn of Chaos are the most horrific of all the Chaos-tainted Humans, for in appearance at least they live up to their name, seeming to have been created from an eruption of the raw stuff of Chaos into the world. Yet as I say, these too were once Human, belying their current vile and misshapen form. For many, the transformation may have begun with the growth of a single extra finger on one hand, or a patch of fur between the shoulders. Thus and so does Chaos gain its first handhold upon mortal man. If he embraces his newfound mutation, seeking out the dark corruption of the Chaos Gods by one means or another, he will gain more mutations, and thus the road to Spawndom continues. Pure chaos is the most addictive and evil drug imaginable, far more so than any potion or herb of the Unspeakable One, for pure Chaos promises prolonged life, personal power, and dominion over others. . . Every one of the basest of Human emotions is catered to. Many think that by begging their dark masters for mutation after mutation, they will some day be godlike themselves, and perhaps this is true for a tiny minority. For most of those who strive to achieve such a destiny, though, the taint of Chaos will one day overwhelm not merely their conscious wills, but their very bodies, transforming them into those gibbering, swollen, amorphous blobs known as the Spawn of Chaos. Not only do they no longer look Human, they no longer even look like they might once have been Human, as most Beastmen or other Mutants do.";

It was you, you and your kind\; you made me a bad person. You fear anything that\'s different. My own village feared me once they found out, called me tainted by Chaos, drove me out of town with torches and pitchforks they did. Well. I\'m not one to argue with my old neighbours, especially when they outnumber me fifty-to-one. If they thought I was some kind of Chaos Beast, well, I felt it would be only fair if I lived up to their fears. I fled to the woods, and there I found more Mutants, more of my kind. We lived by scavenging and raiding, mostly, till we ended up fighting the Beastmen. Yes, they killed most of my companions, but they took me among them when they saw I was part Beast myself, and when they saw how well I fought. That was when I had to make the decision. It was clear I was never going to make much of a name for myself among them just for what I was—the lack of horns soon put paid to any illusions I might have had about that. So the best way I could make myself useful to them, make sure I didn\'t end up on a cooking spit myself, was to lead them to the village and tell them what it had in the way of defences and loot. Turnabout is fair play, after all. It had been made quite clear to me that I was no longer welcome there myself, so what were the people to me? Nothing. Nothing but tasty meat and good loot. Yes that\'s right, I ate my own erstwhile neighbours when the fight was done, or bits of them anyway... Bov the Butcher\'s shoulder was particularly good, fat and succulent. Yes, I\'m a monster.

quotes[57] = "Of course, the Chameleoleech and its origins are a topic of much heated debate, but I feel it is a debate already won. Just between you and I, the pseudo—science of those blasted \'Colleges\' makes me sick to the bone. Especially those Magisters of the Golden Order, with their claims of \'logical process\' and \'principles of science\' when they, truly, have a blind reliance on... on witchery! Should they reach a difficult question, they always retreat to that tired old phrase: \'But, it\'s the aethyr, isn\'t it!\' Well, no, it isn\'t.<br/><br/>The Chameleoleech is a natural creature, and there is no need to turn to \'magic\' to find answers. If those Magisters bothered to study a real book, instead of those silly tomes of hocus-pocus that they are so fond of, they might understand that. Let me explain, since you seem more reasonable than they. First, the deliriant — or, to be technical, the anticholinergio — is a dissociative humour that blocks certain flows of the mind, resulting in delusions of an extreme nature. This is no more supernatural an event in origin than Deadly Nightshade or Mandrake\'s pharmaceutical qualities, both of which are powerful deliriants. As you may note, the two plants I mention are also  if taken in large doses. The same, I\'m afraid, applies to the Chameleoleech. Every time one is exposed, one poisons oneself. These poisonous humours build up in the body until eventually the victim dies. Indicators that this fate is immanent include sensitivity to light, dry flesh, dilated pupils, and blurred vision. Chameleoleeches truly are fascinating creatures, but to trivialise them with crack—pot theories without any scientific basis is, to me, a worse crime than using magic in the first place!";

quotes[58] = "Yes, Gebhardt, bring me the jellied eels. Whenever I return to Altdorf, it\'s always the first dish I have\; they remind me of my youth. Now, where were we? Oh, yes, those damned leeches! Several months ago I made the mistake of leading a seminar at the University about the Aethyric influence upon the fauna of the Empire. It was a powerful speech, if I do say so myself. I had expected a good response. A foolish fantasy, of course, but I was blinded by what I felt was the obvious nature of my conclusions. The beards weren\'t so easily convinced. I caused somewhat of a ruckus, and not a little offence. But, since you ask, I\'ll explain the nature of those leeches again\: Blood is redolent with iron. Iron is metal. Chamon, the Yellow Wind of Magic, is attracted to metal. So, leeches attract Chamon in significant quantities for their size, as they are often bloated with blood.<br/><br/>Now, before I continue, are you sure you understand that? Yes? Impressive! Vampires do indeed attract a great deal of Chamon. It makes them static. I t fuels their immortality. Your master is wise to put so much faith in you. You have a fast mind. Anyway, none of this is too controversial. It is all easily proved by anyone with the Sight. Now, here\'s the bit that isn\'t so widely accepted\: I believe Chamon is not all about alchemy. I believe it is also about greed. High concentrations of Chamon can blind the susceptible with desire. This, perhaps, is why gold inflicts others with such greed. We are greedy for it due to the Chamon concentration in the metal. Now, assuming you\'ve kept up, which it seems you have, let me conclude\: Because leeches are suffuse with Chamon, it has mutated some of them permanently. Some of those changed, so called Chameleoleeches, can instinctually inflict visions of greed and base desires upon their prey. Thus, victims are blinded to the leeches\' true intent of parasitic hemophagia. So, yes, they are creatures permanently changed by Aethyric forces - in this case, Chamon — and are not naturally occurring entities, unless you see the Winds of Chaos as natural. Ah, perfect timing! Here come my eels! I do so like my eels!";

That is a grim tale best suited for long winter nights, but I will impart the substance of it. Long ago, the fell Chaos kindred of the Dwarfs needed a steady source of reliable troops. The Greenskin races that they had to deal with at the time they deemed less than adequate, so using their sorcery and a carefully applied breeding program, they set about creating a new strain of Orc. They sought to make them stronger, hardier and more intelligent that they could better carry out the will of the Chaos Dwarfs. They succeeded far beyond their expectations and desires. Black Orcs were the result of their labours and within a few short years of their creation, they began rebellion after rebellion in an unbroken line. At first, all of their revolts were easily crushed, as they were only a few Black Orcs leading hordes of lesser Orcs and Goblins, but as the numbers of the Black Orcs multiplied, the danger grew. Finally, they all but succeeded in taking Zharr-Naggrund and would\'ve if not for a last minute betrayal by the Hobgoblins. Exactly what the Hobgoblins did to betray their cousins has never been verifiably recorded, and there are many versions of the tale.

The Father of Corruption is somewhat different, appealing to those who have seen the horror of plague and would prefer to embrace it rather than suffer it themselves. The only way to resist the corrupting power of Chaos is to scourge out our secret desires by whatever means we can\; a life of asceticism and contemplation or a life dedicated to warring on Chaos wherever it is found are the two best methods.

Even with my hands pressed against my ears I could still hear it. I was crouched against the floor, hoping it would end, when I heard a very different sort of sound, and that close by. A kind of snuffling sound. I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise and I figure I\'d picked a bear\'s cave. Wasn\'t no bear, though. As I looked back into the darkness, two luminous eyes like kindled fires lit up and looked about. In the flashes of lightning, I saw scaled legs scrabble against the rock as the thing stood upright. It walked past without even bothering to glance at me. Last I saw it, it was scaling straight up a cliff.

Many years ago, back when I was naught but a freshly graduated journeyman, there was a terrible incursion of Chaos from the north. A series of swiftly moving war bands were decimating the towns and making travel all but impossible. The Emperor called for volunteers to stand against the brigands and specifically asked for members of the Wizardly colleges to join the crusade. I fell in with a rowdy bunch, each of us eager to prove ourselves and represent our orders well. Among my companions was an arrogant third son of a noble named Ulamar von Carroburg from the Celestial Order. Ulamar made a point of snubbing the rest of us, declaring that the stars foretold that he would play a most significant part in our upcoming struggle, which was eventually to prove all too true. At first we fought in a number of small skirmishes, acquitting ourselves well, until the day that our General finally brought the foe to battle on an open plain and we learned that we were indeed dealing with far more than mere raiders. A group of armoured Chaos knights stood alongside countless Beastmen and on their flank stood a group of those legendary beings known as Dragon Ogres. Those with a greater taste for conflict than I could tell you more of that terrible battle. I remember it as being an appalling affair that I only wished to survive through. At the height of it, the Dragon Ogres ploughed into General Kromach\'s bodyguard and Ulamar sought to stop them by unleashing lightning from the heavens, proving that he had never bothered to study our foe. Dragon Ogres consume naught but lightning. They went absolutely berserk as the energy from Ulamar\'s spell coursed over them. They slaughtered the General, all of his men, and Ulamar in less time than it takes me to tell it. I obviously managed to survive the battle, if only just.

The presence of Dragon Ogres in any Chaos Host is a grim omen for it signals the importance the forces of Chaos place on the venture. They will not commit those ancient beasts unless there is much to be gained in the venture, though as always, it is difficult to determine what they believe is important as the followers of Chaos do not reason as sane men. As to fighting those fell creatures, consider fighting one in the same light you would regard struggling against a fully armoured knight with several thousand years of experience. Daunting? Perhaps.

I have not had the honour of meeting him, but I\'m reliably told that each of his foreclaws is as large as a warhorse and when he takes a full breath, all within a hundred paces fall unconscious due to the lack of air, as it is all sucked into his titanic lungs. There has never been a new Shartak born since the dawn on which they successfully bargained for their \'immortality\' with the Gods. The very lighting that fuels their bodies has rendered them infertile. Knowing my Lord as much as any mortal can, I suspect he deemed it a grand jest, forcing them to trade one sort of longevity for another, but I digress. What is important to know is that they are ancient beyond Human reckoning and their wisdom is vast. Even as they dream down the long ages, their spirits wander learning much of the world. When they finally rise at the thunder\'s call, they are often amazingly well informed of current events before being told. My fourth tutor, a being I honour before all others save one, was a Shaggoth named Tirsoknaia. He told me that his people hold their dreams to be their reality and regard the brief years they are forced to stay awake as their dreams.

One spring night, we we\'re heading home from fishing when a beautiful girl stepped out of the shadows of the trees and beckoned to us. I was afraid, but Hugo went to her without hesitation. When Hugo didn\'t return the next day, the elders asked me what had happened, but I told them I didn\'t know. Eventually, they gave Hugo up for dead. I didn\'t see my friend again for nearly three decades, until a certain spring night, when I chanced to be near the trees where last I\'d seen Hugo. A young man came walking out of the woods and to my astonishment, I realised it was he, but that he hadn\'t aged a day. He started to speak to me, but then his eyes widened, as if from fear.

A few years ago, my unit was serving with one of the western Empire lordlings to fill out his ranks while he made a little \'expedition\' into Bretonnia. Word of our coming preceded our force as a group of knights were awaiting us on a fair green field as we came down out of a Grey Mountain pass. The woods of Athel Loren lay just to the south of us and somebody got the bright idea of having some lads go off through a few large copses of trees so that we could flank the Bretonnians. As ever, us mercenaries got the short straw and off we went. Well we got no more than a hundred or paces or so when these beautiful girls came wandering out of the trees right in front of us. Some of them were dressed in the sheerest cloth I\'d ever seen, so much so that they might as well have been naked. Now I can\'t really say why, but something about their appearance or the way they swayed forward grinning, or maybe my companion\'s reactions set me off and I started laughing, which is why I\'m alive to tell you this story. When the Dryads, for such I later learned they were, got within about ten paces of us, their pretty features twisted into horrible leering visages and they proceeded to annihilate some of the most hardened soldiers its been my pleasure to serve with. Their limbs grew long and sprouted dagger-like thorns, then they charged. One of them smashed me aside with a blow aimed to knock me unconscious. I woke up several hours later, surrounded by the corpses of my fellows and one of those fey women winsomely smiling down at me. When she saw that I was awake she leaned forward to press against me and run a finger along my jaw line. \'Tell your fellows, Laughing One,\' she whispered huskily, \'that we\'d rather they stay out of our woods, hmm?\' Her breath smelled of loam, hyacinth, and blood.

However, despite the great range of the tales, Dryads have only ever been verifiably sighted in the primordial forest of Athel Loren. Why this should be is unknown. Perhaps they are magical constructs, crafted by the mystical Elf witch who is said to rule that realm, or maybe they are actually female Elves who have been somehow transformed by exposure to Athel Loren. I subscribe to another theory. I believe that they are an extension of the forest itself, which explains why they have never been sighted elsewhere. They are a defence mechanism, if you will, for the trees of that magical wood.

The winds at this altitude were bone-chilling, and they whipped through the many holes in the tower levels below and produced a low moaning howl. It had been a full cycle of the moon since the Red Eye tribe had captured this stronghold, but the insides still reeked of smoke, ale, and Stunty in general. Grotnib longed to be off watch duty and back in the armer confines of the dark tunnels. If he squinted, he could just make out the next Stunty tower. It was hard to spot, hewn from the rock as it was. Even now, the tower was full of beardies who were probably looking out at him and massing for another attack. The thought of the fierce Stunts worried Grotnib back to his duty, and he roused himself. He rattled the long pole, that held the topmost lookout - one of many Snotlings that they had caught raiding the mushroom caverns. All the little runts resisted going up the pole, but it gave \'em extra lookout distance. After all, the Stunts had already launched two counterattacks to retake their watchtower. Even after a good shake, there was no sound from above. Grotnib leaned back and focused his beady red eyes. Sure enough, the runt was still up there - curled around the top like a lump. Grouting yelled, cursed, threw stones, and finally shook with as much vigor as he could muster. As the pole swayed back and forth, at the very zenith of its swing, the Snotling dropped off. Momentarily framed against the clear night sky, the runt plummeted. Grotnib pulled down his hood, cocked his ear, and was rewarded by a faint squish from the rocks below.<br/><br/>Grotnib shook his head, cupped his gnarled hands to his mouth and shouted. \'Oi, down there. Send us up annuver Runt. Da last one froze up and fell off again.\'";

quotes[188] = "You hold in your hand the work of a lifetime. To compile this tome I travelled thousands of miles, learned dozens of languages, fought to save both my life and my soul, lost my left hand and nearly my tongue! Though age now dims my eyes, I can go to Morr\'s Realm content that no finer study of the monsters of the Old World has yet been written.<br/>The greatest irony of all is that I had no intention of writing a book such as this when I first became of a man of letters. When I was young, I had just graduated from the University of Altdorf when I had my first run in with a true monster. I was riding to Wurtbad to see my family when I came upon a scene of carnage in the forest. A war herd of Beastman had attacked<br/>a group of pilgrims and killed them to a man. It was a gruesome sight, more so because a lone Beastman had stayed behind to feed on the rather large corpse of a cheese maker. When I came upon the scene, the creature looked up from its meal. I can still see its goat head and horns and<br/>the bestial cast of its features. I can see the way its bloody mouth foamed when it realised there was fresher meat on the road. I can see the black depths of its eyes and the cruel barbs of its blade. I drank in this scene, dumbstruck, as the Beastman leapt over corpses and raced for my horse. After years at the university, I was so used to studying things objectively that it took me precious seconds to realise that this was not the moment for detachment. This creature meant to kill me and I needed to do something about it before the Beastman used my vitae to wash down the cheese maker.<br/>I managed to draw, cock, and fire my pistol and just in time too. The Beastman was in mid-leap when my pistol ball caught it in the chest and ended its life. As it lay dying, the creature spoke, or so it seemed to me. It was no language I had heard before, however. Fascinated, I dismounted and approached the dying Beastman. It looked at me with those eyes and seemed to curse me as it died. I stood there for a long time, staring at the corpse. The Beastman was a monster, clearly, but what more did we know about such creatures? It had language surely and the Beastmen seemed to have<br/>a society of sorts. What was it that made them monsters, I wondered? And what could Humanity learn of such creatures to safeguard itself against further depredations? To unearth such truths and to expand the knowledge of our glorious Empire—that would be a worthy undertaking, I decided.<br/>And that is how it began. My curiosity blossomed into a series of journeys, each more perilous than the last. Fifty years I spent on the road, gathering up all the information I could find. I should have died a hundred times over but Fate was my guide. I persevered and over the years the Work took shape. The result of these decades is Perilous Beasts\: A Study of Creatures Fair and Foul.<br/>You will no doubt notice, gentle readers, that much of this book consists of quotations or transcribed testimony from witnesses, experts, and even the witless. It was my intent to show the breadth of opinion and thought on these creatures, with words from the most ignorant peasant to the most eminent scholar. I have also added my own thoughts, based on my research, interviews, and findings. Should Shallya grant me more years, I may yet write of my own adventures compiling this book, but such details are not germane to the work and my hubris is not such that I must make this book into my story.<br/>I began this tome as a search for truth and while I\'m certain there is truth in these pages, even I can\'t tell you exactly where it lies. I have sought to illuminate the threats that face the Old World but only Lord Sigmar can protect us from the machinations of evil and the enemy within. May he guide and watch over us all.";

If you learn the tactics of one Orc, you are likely to know them all, though the exceptions are always warlords who rise to lead the biggest hordes. Goblins and their ilk are far cagier and the Goblin tribes that venerate the moon are downright evil. The Hobgoblins, though, are firm believers in keeping what they view as an entirely practical outlook, namely that those in power only get to stay that way by continually proving themselves. Hobgoblins respect strength and cunning alone, differing to those that they believe have both qualities in abundance. First time I had to command a Hobgoblin squad, I decked the first one that cheeked me and killed his wolf with my bare hands. That set the lot of them straight and I had no problems with them the rest of that campaign. Still, they constantly search for weakness in those around them and if they ever find it, they will pick on such an individual mercilessly until the target of their ridicule stands up for himself or dies. You can never entirely trust one of the squinty blighters, excepting that you can always trust him to do what he feels is best for his own interests at any given moment. This attitude must make ruling the Hobgoblin hordes of the Great Steppes harder than keeping an Ogre on limited rations, for they are an eternally fractious race. I\'ve lost track of the number of scraps I\'ve had to break up amidst Hobgoblins and, well, just about everybody else. Scarred old mate of mine named Shoresh, least whys as close to a friend as I\'ve ever had among them, seeing as he didn\'t stick me when he had the chance, told me there have been many Hobgobla Khans over time. Most fall in battle or are sorted out by assassination with great regularity. Only the infamous Morcar Kahn the Cunning managed to die of old age.

Their speed is unquestionably the most impressive trait about them. Certainly not the speed of their thoughts, of course, but of their mounts. We often range our cannon by gauging the movements of their forward lines. If a few of them get annihilated in the initial ranging shots, no great loss. None of us are under any illusions though.

I was far more adventurous back then, prone to getting into all sorts of mischief. My mother was continually after me to stop straying into the woods, telling me that all sorts of terrible monsters lurked there. I wasn\'t afraid because a house of Knight\'s Panther had a small fortress near where we lived and I didn\'t think any beasts would be foolish enough to come near them. Like I said, I was very young. My explorations had grown more and more bold, as I went further and further into the recesses of the wood. Now forests can be dark places and overgrown ancient forests can be very near pitch black even at noon. So it was that one day, I went too far and became lost unable to find the path back in the dim light. I wandered for hours, growing more and more afraid until I stumbled onto a rock-strewn path. At least, I thought it was rocks. After a time, I passed into a lighted clearing where I discovered that the path I was on was actually lined with broken shards of bone. Before me rose a massive black rock, covered with runes that hurt my eyes when I looked at them. About the base of the rock were piles of armour and rusted weapons. I started to flee but the dull crunch of a heavy hoof landing on bone stopped me. I turned and looked up and up and up at the head of a bull which towered above me. A Minotaur, for such it was, looked down at me with dark eyes that showed no emotion that I could see. His body was as muscled as a warhorse\'s. He was covered with tattoos and scars. In one hand, he clenched an axe with a blade as long as I was tall. He snorted once and the air from his nostrils almost knocked me over. One huge arm rose from his side and I did the best that I could to prepare for death. When no blow fell, I slowly opened my eyes. The Minotaur was pointing to an arch in the trees that I had not seen. He spoke then, his voice deep as a well and strangely melodic. \'That way, young one. Return when you have more meat on your bones. You\'ll make for a worthier challenge and a better meal.\' I fled without looking back and it was surely Sigmar\'s grace that saved me.";

For every ten Minotaurs you face, you will find one that is different than the others, one highly favoured by the Ruinous Powers. These may have foul or mysterious powers at their disposal, which you will have to combat. Do not despair though. In the end, Chaos tainted or no, they are still just beasts.";

We hamstrung it and still it fought on, swearing in its dark tongue until Morlen but two bolts into the back of its neck. Only then did it slump over, falling heavily to the ground.

I was part of a grand raiding party, seeking to test our blades against the Gharhars, one of our traditional foes. Long time it had been, though and the Gharhars had changed. I tink they gave too much of themselves to the Gods. Their champions all had the marks of the Were and there line was filled with the Stormbulls. You call them Minotaurs, yah? They came roaring and snorting at us, but the proud sons of the north not run so easily and we held against them. Great was the blood letting that day! The ice became red slush for a league or more. The Stormbulls went mad with it, shrieking at the sky. Some of them, they drop their axes and leap on my fellows, biting off limbs and heads with their teeth. We cut them bad, sliced them open and still they would not stop eating the spilt gore. Dere is no wit in their heads when the blood song sings, only the desire to maim and eat.

His fervour perhaps. Yet, it seemed fitting to me that a Minotaur should guard the entrance to that twisted maze for somewhere in my thoughts I knew, or have not yet learned, that there is a connection between the two.

Two fanatical goblins whirling enormous spiked balls on the end of stout chains joined the battle, and most of the enemy host pressed at the back of their ranks.<br/><br/>For three hours we struggled, but finally the assault was repulsed.

We burned the trolls who were trapped inside, and put the goblins to the sword. The foe had left forty-five of their number slain - and we had twenty-five dead, two-score wounded, and others buried beneath the masonry.

I have struggled amidst catacombs and sewers, risking infection or worse. I have ignored no avenue of research, and I can tell you with certainty, not one shred of proof exists that attests to the existence of these so-called \'Skaven\'. Oh, there are dozens of clever forgeries to be sure, many mass-produced by clever rogues seeking to turn a quick profit by selling \'genuine\' rat-men artefacts to the gullible. But of hard evidence, there is none. To think that there is an entire race of insidious rat-men running about under our streets, attempting to undermine the Empire or as the mad would have it, the world entire, yet, has managed to go completely undetected for millennia, why, the very notion is absurd.

I was younger then, and a lot more foolish, so I went with a group of men to give the place a look. All we found were in the village square, where it looked like a struggle of sorts went on. In the side o\' the village well, there was a single star shaped piece of strange metal, a throwing blade of some kind I suspect, that had somehow melted right into the very rock. Had a symbol on it, a marking of three overlaid lines. Georg the Younger was the only one with the courage to touch it. He said the metal felt slippery to the touch. Poor sod died a few days after.

A round of whippings and beatings had no effect on their resolve. My Lord was absolutely enraged. After he calmed down, his nerves doubtless soothed by the beheadings, he put some small sum of silver on the project and declared that he would personally lead it. That led to enough volunteers to create a proper work force. More\'s the pity. Lambs to the slaughter. He took us to the edge of the wood and didn\'t listen when one of the braver commoners insisted that we should take only naturally downed wood, ordering us to cut down several trees in their prime. An hour or so after we felled the first tree, we heard an eerie cry echo through the woods that set all of us to shivering. My Lord declared it a wolf, or some other fell beast, and bade us press on. All work stopped though, when the trunks of the forest parted and shifted before us as if they were made of water. From out of the forest\'s eaves, a creature I thought was mere legend stepped. He was like an oak and he was not. I can\'t explain it better than that. The Treeman stalked forward and thundered a single word with a voice like a hundred boughs breaking at once, \"WHY?\" His Lordship searched for a proper response and finally managed something along the lines of, \"By right of parley, I&#8230;\" Whatever else he was going to say was lost in the muddy ground as the Treeman hit him with an overhand smash so hard that both my Lord and his horse were killed on the instant, felled by that single blow.

Swift was our ride and hard was the journey, but its end brought a sight that I never expected to behold in the years of this life and a victory unlooked for. At the foot of the mountains, we came upon an encampment of Beastmen greater than any I had ever seen. While I had a company of over a hundred, we were outnumbered by at least ten to one. Still I chose to give the order to charge, knowing that it would be my last. As I prepared to lift my voice, I heard the clarion calls of silvery horns echoing down the mountainsides. To my wonderment, the woods began to move, as if they were marching in time to the horns. As the trees reached the Beastmen\'s hastily assembled lines, massive forms rose up out of them, looking for all the world like trees that were playing at being men. At their feet ran lithe maidens who changed before our eyes into howling daemons that tore into the Chaos horde before shifting back to laughing girls once more. My men looked to me, to see what my reaction was going to be. My thoughts were lost when I noticed a large group of Beastmen lighting torches. I gestured towards them calling \'There, the ones who seek to set the wood ablaze,\' and charged. We took the Beastmen, unaware, from behind and we were victorious. As the battle was ending, one of the largest of the tree men walked forward casually stomping still struggling Beastmen as he strode towards me. His eyes were the size of bucklers, but I detected no malice in them and he seemed to regard me with interest. We studied one another for a time, till at last he spoke. His voice was like the creaking of an old house laced with the burbling of a stream. \'Well met, sir knight. Thank you for removing the flame bearers. They may have been... difficult to manage.\' I thanked him in turn for destroying the Chaos troops. \'Harrumph. Despoilers. Foul creatures. Unnatural they are, not part of the turnings of the wood at all.\' He gestured north with a long wooden arm. \'An hour\'s journey, a camp of the Bright Ones, whom you call Wood Elves. Tell them you come with Durthu\'s blessing. Food and safe rest for you and your men.\' He turned and walked away almost as fast as a horse can run, his long strides swiftly carrying him into the shadows of the trees.

The scholar says otherwise, for there are the elusive Dryads. What then, is the Treemen\'s connection to those dangerous fey lovelies? Blagmort suggests that they are attended by the maids, ascribing some sort of harem-like arrangement, a notion I find ludicrous. If, as I have suggested in the past, the Dryads are Athel Loren\'s defence mechanism, then the Treemen could be, in a very real sense, the consciousness of the forest. They are the caretakers of that mystic wood, the generals who direct the efforts of their Dryad troops from the safety of the trees, only taking to the fray when there is no other choice.

My duty lay in defending our land against the incursion of the Sigmarites, but my men were few and the Empire\'s army vast beyond easy reckoning. My scouts could not even give an accurate count of their horde, telling me they numbered as the stars. Still, my obligations were clear and so I prepared my troops to go to their deaths. The night before I engaged the invaders the Enchantress Ciara came to me and spoke of old debts between my line and the denizens of Athel Loren, telling me to send to them for aid. I had always been taught that it was unwise to rouse the People of the Wood, but then again, it is also foolhardy to disobey the advice of an Enchantress. I sent three of my bravest hunters, knowing in my heart that they would never return and even if they could get my plea through, there could be no response that would arrive in time to make any difference. That day I rose to watch the dawn, expecting it to be my last. When we finally engaged the enemy, the battle went as I expected. My men fought bravely, singing psalms to the Lady all the while, but they still fell all the same.

Through some secret yet doubtless epic feat of bravery, betting on exactly what it was being a favoured pastime of the Kiss\' crew, the Captain had managed to secure a full deck of Dwarf cannon and an engineer to oversee them. Logan Druminsfind was not fond of the ocean, but he\'d have given his life in a second for his beloved cannon, or so I thought soon after being introduced to him. Captain and Engineer both surprised us all before the end. On a trading voyage off the coast off Bretonnia, I saw my first, and I hope by Sigmar\'s grace my last, Black Ark of the Dark Ones. Sometime during third watch the entire crew was roused and called to quarters. As we stumbled to our posts, we saw it picked out by moon\'s light on the horizon. It moved like a mountain with sails. We could feel the swell of its passage though it was still long leagues from us. Closer by far were strange castles that sped across the surface of the deep, drawn by hideous sea serpents that still give me nightmares. They roared as they came on, their bellows echoing across the waves, and I think many of the crew gave themselves up for lost but Reiner would hear none of it. He took the wind and held it, giving them a running battle that was to last till dawn. Time and again they would draw near and Druminsfind\'s gunnery would drive the beasts off. I\'ve never seen such sailing or such shooting, yet always, they remained near us. As the sun touched the horizon, Druminsfind left his guns to speak with the Captain. I don\'t know what he said, but Reiner obviously didn\'t like it. Nevertheless, to our astonishment, four cannon and most of the ship\'s powder were placed in a long boat along with the Dwarf. He looked all of us in the eyes, one by one as he prepared to set off, and his final words are still etched in my heart. \'Better this, lads, than ever being caught by them.\' As he rowed off, he began to sing in the hard secret language of the Dwarfs and though I didn\'t know the words, I knew it was a martial song. When the serpent ships drew near him, he set fire to his beloved cannon. The explosion killed one at least and caused the rest to scatter. That was all that Reiner needed to bring the Fortune\'s Kiss out of danger. I\'ve never seen a Dark One, only their damned ships, but that was more than enough.";

Though he roamed the ocean on many a trip and was gone for years at a time, she was ever faithful to him. After long years of awaiting his return, when his ship finally came into port, she rushed down to meet her love, but on his travels, he had found another and spurned her. She hid her pain, went back to her temple and began to instruct the birds as to her will. With subtle enchantments she bound them to her and she to them, mixing her very blood with theirs. When she was ready, she summoned her lord with honeyed words, saying that she bore him no malice and would give him and his new bride tokens of her affection. Not understanding the danger they were in, they came unto her temple. There on the edge of the sea, they were torn to pieces. But seeing her lord, whom she still loved, slain before her by her own will, Nashara went mad with grief.

When first we heard it, we thought it was merely a trick of the winds, but the closer it came, the louder its cry. It was like nothing I\'ve heard before or since. Its roar is the death of hope mixed with the wail of babes torn from their mothers\' breasts. It bellowed as it came upon us\; the winged death, the Manticore and our steeds, though war trained and battle tested, tried to flee before it. My brother knight Holger and his horse became naught but red ruin as it fell upon them, greedy for their warm flesh, which it ripped, steaming, from their bones as we looked on in horror. Oktar charged it and received a tale slap for his efforts that bent his breastplate in twain. The beast looked about at us, its mockery of a Human face bloody with its kills, and seeing that we weren\'t afraid, tried to take to wing, perhaps to flee, perhaps to come at us from another angle. We were never to know, for as it stretched forth its massive leathery pinions and began to take flight, Captain Reinwald dealt it such a fierce blow with his hammer that its joint gave way with a resounding crack and it plummeted, screaming all the while, into the valley below us.

More likely to appease their hunger, I should think, but still it goes to showing just how powerfully a Hydra can affect those who\'ve encountered it. This is no surprise, as Hydras are nearly immortal beasts, living down through the long years untouched by time\'s ravages. The Crimson Scourge of Zhufbar, a particularly large red Hydra, has been periodically terrorizing the region around that city for well over a thousand years. Every time some courageous warrior gets set to slay it he\'s either killed or only manages to wound it. After a few decades sleep in the deep caves around Black Water the Scourge once again emerges, its injuries regenerated and its fury unabated. I\'ve lost track of the number of tales I\'ve heard about Hydras, but Hydra slayers? I know only one such story and the hero died along with the Hydra.";

quotes[465] = "Yes gentlemen, I think it worthwhile to consider the Hydra as a foe. You say no creature of Chaos is predictable, yet I submit that they are as stable as any beast so subject to mutation can be. Times being as they are, our brave soldiers may soon face one or more of them on the field of war. You have asked me to uncover the weaknesses of that which you may fight\; should you confront a Hydra, your target lies within its torso. Every parcel of information that I\'ve discovered convinces me that their large central trunk is what truly holds the Hydra\'s brain. How else could its many heads function in concert, with no great loss of function if several are destroyed? Each may certainly have a vestigial intellect, but the central controlling mind is in the body. Unfortunately, the organ that ignites their fiery breath lies as the junction of their necks, close to the brain and the spot is, naturally, very well armoured in scales. I strongly suggest that our artillerists aim for the front and centre of the torso, as nothing else short of a full charge by an armoured knight will penetrate that armoured hide over that most crucial of spots.";

Only when it stalked forward could I discern the swaying of its numerous heads. My squire gasped \'Hydra!\' and I knew he was right. Two raiders dressed in black armour drove it forward with razored whips and what I presume were foul curses in their dark tongue. I remember being surprised that the beast didn\'t just consume them for their temerity, so massive did it seem when compared to their slight forms. Cruelty knows no frame, I suppose. Some of the peasants lost heart at the sight of it, but knights live for the privilege of facing such a foe. It did not die easy, but in the end it did fall, though it took many brave souls with it. If you should ever have to face such, see to it that you kill its handlers quickly. After they died in a volley, the Hydra was confused for a time and attacked a few of the raiders that strayed too near it.";

When we went to war against the forces of Chaos, they carried the greatest of our heroes upon their backs and they were ever the first to engage the enemy and the last to withdraw from the field.

It was all muscle and scale\; none of its mass was given over to fat in any way that I could discern. It moved with such deadly grace that, even though Varek\'s valiant final attack had deeply wounded it, it still slid across the floor of the cavern with a smooth undulation that knew no pause. Its leathern wings were held fast against its body in the close confines of the cave, though they flexed a little as it reared to face us. Its claws were longer than a man is tall, the smallest of its teeth the length of a forearm. Its tail was a razored weapon of flesh and serrated bone. I could smell the stink of Warpstone on its breath, the whole of its lair reeked of it. Its eyes glowed with madness and hatred. Every instinct that I possessed told me to flee screaming, away from it. Had I not the misfortune of once facing a Greater Daemon of Chaos, I would\'ve sworn to Sigmar that it was the most frightening creature I have ever fought. As it was, it came in a very close second.";

quotes[503] = "They would seem to be able to ignite the very air itself, which gives rise to conjecture that their breath is, in fact, of magical origin. This is certainly supported by the fact that no tale suggests that a Dragon ever \'runs out\' of fire. If they had an internal organ that was producing fuel of some kind they could, presumably, lose their flame. I know of no natural source of heat, save the molten rock of volcanoes, which is capable of readily melting stone like a Dragon\'s breath can. I\'ve also heard tales of Dragons that have been touched by Chaos in such a way that their breath is somehow corrupted by the contact and carries the stench of Warpstone. I must confess that I\'m not certain whether that argues for a natural or magical origin for Dragon fire, but it\'s interesting all the same. Why is this important? I\'ll tell you why. If you should ever have to face Dragons on the field of war and their breath is of magical origin, you may be able to dispel it as you would any other enemy enchantment. Something to consider, eh?";

Indeed, their entire internal structure is completely different from that of any horses that I\'ve examined. Pegasi are omnivorous creatures, capable of eating both flesh and vegetable matter whereas horses are strictly grazers. Those corrupted by the Taint are frequently entirely carnivorous, their normally flat teeth often sharpening into vicious fangs. Their bone structure, unsurprisingly, is far more similar to that of birds than those of horses, which is part of what allows them flight. I must confess however, that I do not think their ability to fly is entirely explainable by natural law. I know of a Pegasus that carried a heavily armoured knight upon her back with no sign of strain even after twelve hours of sustained flight, a feat that seems impossible. An acquaintance of mine from the College of Light suggests that Pegasi may somehow be able to literally \'ride\' on the Winds of Magic that blow from the north.

Several of the foals that we\'ve reared have never learned to fly, their wings atrophying, as they grew older. Even those that had mothers who actively participated in their flying lessons didn\'t always take to it. I suspect that without the inherent danger of the high mountain nests that a more naturally reared Pegasus grows up with, they are smart enough to realise that they don\'t truly have a \'need\' to fly. Thus, we are still at the mercy of the mountaineers and the Dwarf rangers who specialise in acquiring Pegasi foals.

I knew nothing of the mountains and less of Hippogriffs, but I was determined to free myself from a life of drudgery. I\'ll not bore you with the details of the journey. It was longer than I had imagined and tougher as well. In the foothills of the mountains, the Lady took pity on me and I met a sympathetic hunter who told me what to do. Correspondingly, I waited in the woods till another had managed the near impossible task of bringing a live Hippogriff chick down from the mountains. As that brave and lucky soul rested, I slit his throat and claimed the chick as my own.

You should certainly never regret not fighting one.<br/><br/>As soon as you look at a Wyvern you know that here is a beast built for one purpose only — battle. From the solidly boned, horned head to the great barbed blade of a tail, there is no part of the creature that is not either armour or weapon. It will gore and rip with the horns\; bite, chew, and swallow with the fanged maw\; slash and rend with its claws\; impale with the spiked wing pinions\; buffet with the wings\; crush with its torso\; slap, slice, and stab with the tail. Its head and back are covered with wide thick scales that cannot be hacked through with anything less than a hard and lucky blow from a poleaxe. Its belly scales are softer, but to get to them you must get past all its weapons...<br/><br/>When we battled Azhag the Slaughterer at Osterwald, I saw a unit of knights charge him early in the fight, hurling themselves into the fray with the desperate urge for glory that comes over so many of noble blood. They charged too early, but they at least had the sense to attack the Wyvern first\; few Orcs ever lived who were more dangerous than a Wyvern, even Azhag. You had to admire their valour, and their sacrifice was probably what broke Azhag\'s horde in the long run. Half a dozen lances stabbed home deep into its body, but it was fighting back even as they pierced it, biting a head off here, slicing a cavalier almost in half with a backhanded claw attack there. Azhag of course was laying about him to, like I say not quite as deadly as his mount but still slashing through harness and into the flesh beneath with his axe. Only one knight survived more than a few seconds past the initial charge, leaping off his dead horse and unlimbering the heavy war sword he carried at his saddle. He hacked and hacked at its neck as it fought back furiously. I\'ve never seen a man move so fast and lithe in full plate armour, but there it was, he evaded almost every attack from Wyvern and Orc alike, or lessened their force so they only struck him glancing blows. With one final shout of effort he cut its neck almost right through, its head hanging limply to one side. I think he was about to try to plant his foot on the neck and clamber up to battle Azhag directly, when the dead Wyvern\'s tail shot forward like a ballista bolt, straight through the centre of the breastplate and out the backplate. He must have died almost instantly. I never found out who he was, but without him the rest of us might never have got to Azhag to battle him directly. Once Azhag was dead—and that is very much another story, and was no easy task to accomplish you can be sure — his forces fled and scattered. He had been the only thing holding them together.";

The guide I finally secured answered to the name of Razim and I found him to be of a singularly untrustworthy sort, but I had little choice in the matter as he alone showed any willingness to escort me to the fabled ruins of Bel Aliad. Our journey was long and monotonous, the only constants that I can recall being sand, wind and relentless heat by day followed by bitter chill at night. Many times Razim suggested that we turn back, stating that it was foolhardy. He thought that I meant to loot the ancient city; an irony considering what was yet to come. After two hard weeks we arrived at the outskirts of what remained of the City of Healers. Razim stated that he would go no farther, but would wait for me for two days before returning to the port of Zandri. Poor fool, if he had stayed true to his words he might\'ve seen old age, but I curse him not as his dishonesty benefited me in the end.<br/><br/>The first day, I found no trace of the wisdom I sought, nor could I decipher the location of the Library of Horeptis. On the second day, I awoke to the prodding of a bronze headed spear, clutched in the hand of an armoured skeletal warrior. I\'ve have seen such sights in my days that I\'m all but jaded to terror, but being awoken by one of the undead surely took another year or two off my life. A group of similarly armed skeletons allowed me to dress, then forcibly lead me to a gilded courtyard. At the centre of the square stood a massive marble throne, upon which sat a magnificently arrayed being, resplendent in jewels and rune inscribed bandages. His eyeless gaze bore into me as I stood before him and I bowed as I would to a king. Next to him stood a withered looking man in priestly vestments, Razim sat on the ground before him, gold and jewels lying clustered at his feet. The mummy nodded at the priest who looked at me and then spoke, to my astonishment, in Reikspiel. \'His Radiance Sutekh, Guardian of the Waters of Life, Prince of the Shifting Sands wishes to know why you have come so far to loot his possessions.\' I looked at Razim and saw my doom in his actions if I was not very clever. But kings are kings, undead or otherwise and I knew what to say. \'I came not for mighty Sutekh\'s gold but for his world renowned wisdom, for Bel Aliad is a city of healing and I am in desperate need of a healer.\' And so, I told the undead pharaoh of my woes, of my love Karelia\'s poisoning at the hands of Heinrich von Bruno and my desperate quest. The priest quietly translated all to the unmoving mummy. When I finished the courtyard was still for the span of three heartbeats. Sutekh gestured and Razim\'s head was struck off his shoulders. He spoke and then, amazingly he smiled, nodding to me once before he rose and departed, his armoured guard smoothly withdrawing to surround him. The priest walked to me and said, \'My lord commands me to tell you that he too, loved once. He too, would\'ve gone to the ends of the world to save his love. I am to show you the wisdom you seek.\' If not for Razim\'s greed, I would never have found the hidden place that the wizened priest took me to and my Karelia would\'ve been lost to me forever.

We soon found out what he\'d been using them bodies for — place was thick with Zombies, and a lot of the lads legged it, but we fought them back with flames until we could put the place to the torch. You can see the blackened ruins from here on a clear day, when the mist hasn\'t rolled right in from Mount Schober there. On a clear night you can see it even better, and see the old Marquis still flapping about in his big black cloak, waving his arms and still doing his \'particular researches.\' My own cousin Hans took the Priest of Sigmar out there on his boat to drive away the evil spirit, but the Priest never come back and Hans has never been the same since, floated up on our shore a week later half-drowned and half-terrified to death he did.";

The survivor, Alexander, told me afterwards that it was only chance that saved him, and probably we sleepers too. The Vampire Bats had attacked Heinrich and Franz in the night, striking simultaneously and silently from opposite sides of the campfire. Alexander had been off to one side, relieving himself, and was able to shout an alarm an instant before the monsters realised there were three guards not two.

In this version of events, the first Vampire Bats fed upon a sleeping Vampire by accident, assuming him to be a living Human\; perhaps he had recently fed himself, and still glowed with the warmth and blood of his victim. The other theory posits that they were the creation of a powerful Necrarch Vampire or perhaps a Necromancer, who desired a powerful flying strike force to supplement his Undead legions. In either case, the biggest mystery is whether they reproduce like living animals—making them the only known Undead to do so—or whether they may only be created by some other means, perhaps the sorceries of another powerful master of Undeath.";

quotes[603] = "The most well-known Vampire bloodline is that of the von Carsteins, but that is not to say that the other lineages are any less powerful. The von Carsteins are very much the \'standard\' type of Vampire, if such a claim is reasonable\; not because the other bloodlines are derived from them or subservient to them, but simply because we scholars know far more about the von Carsteins, historically a major foe to the Empire, than we know about the rest. Scholars know of four other major Vampire bloodlines.<br/><br/>The most powerful sorcerers, particularly in the realm of Necromancy, are undoubtedly the Necrarchs. Though they do not have quite the same physical strength and martial prowess as some of the more warlike lineages, the Necrarchs more than make up for it in the realm of magic. Their origins lie in the sultry city of Lahmia, at the very birth of the Vampire race. Necrarchs stay hidden from the sight of men, in catacombs deep beneath the earth or ghost-haunted castles far from civilization. There they plot and wait, contemplating some long-term plans, which are rumoured to include the slaying of everyone in the world and raising them all as undead slaves. Supposedly, they would create an unchanging, mist-laden land, heavy and dolorous with the eternal servitude of their thralls.<br/><br/>The Lahmias are as renowned for their charms and seductions as are the Cultists of the Lord of Pleasure\; perhaps more so, for the Lahmias have had half an eternity to perfect their dark and beguiling arts. Just as the Necrarch\'s minions are the Undead legions at their command, a Lahmia Vampire\'s tools are Humanity. Their beauty is quite literally captivating\; many a bold knight that set out to slay a Lahmia found himself a part of her retinue by sunrise, held enthralled by her languorous beauty, willing to fight and die for his new Lady. The Lahmias are also renowned for their quickness and deadliness on the field of battle, should they ever have cause to fight.<br/><br/>The Blood Dragons are an intriguing lineage. On first investigating them, they might appear to be merely the most skilful warriors of the Vampire clans. This in itself would be a significant insight, but perhaps just as significant is the realization that they have a bizarre parody of a chivalric code. Just as Zombies who have not been given orders by their controller sometimes revert aping what they once did in life, so a Blood Dragon Vampire attempts to live his Undead life according to a warped version of the code of conduct he might once have had as a living knight. They even claim to have honour, of a sort. How much of this is self-delusion, and how often they genuinely strive for and achieve a virtuous life (in so far as a Vampire can be virtuous at all) is a matter still very much open to debate.<br/><br/>Finally we come to the most degenerate of all the Vampire bloodlines, the Strigoi. Outcast from their more civilised brethren, these slavering creatures more closely resemble Ghouls or Daemons than the idealised Human forms of the von Carsteins, Blood Dragons and Lahmias. They are consumed by hatred for almost all living things, but particularly for the other Vampire bloodlines. Interestingly the name Strigoi hints at an association with the travelling caravans of the Strigany, wandering hither and yon throughout the Empire and beyond with no kingdom to call their own. The Strigany have long since been rumoured to harbour the evil Strigoi within their ranks, but nothing has ever been proven. Yet still the Witch Hunters and vengeful mobs attack Strigany wherever they go, solely out of this confusing similarity of names.<br/><br/>It seems likely that other Vampire lineages also exist, lesser-known ones that have remained so secretive or so small that they have never come to the attention of Vampire experts.";

quotes[605] = "We were hired to head into Sylvania and rescue some merchant\'s daughter, she\'d supposedly been kidnapped by a group of Sylvanian nobles so one of them could take her to wife. Now, you\'d have thought any merchant would be pleased to have his child marry into the nobility, but seemingly she was a real beauty and he had high hopes for her—thought she could marry a Duke or something a bit closer to one of the bigger cities, so as the merchant could see plenty of her and keep up his business. He didn\'t much fancy moving to the darks of Sylvania, so when the noble and his knights first came to court her, the merchant rejected them. Count von Bierstein—that was the name he used— didn\'t take things too well, stormed out of the place swearing the merchant would be sorry. He and his men came back in the night. No one even heard the girl scream—maybe she was sweet on him even then.<br/><br/>That was where we came in. Usual daily rate applied, plus we negotiated a good bonus if we brought her back. It was clear he meant \'brought her back alive,\' but I didn\'t want to worry him too much—just enough to want to pay us well. Most of the lads were happy enough with the deal. Sure, we were off to one of the most squalid backwaters of the Empire, but it was still the Empire\; still safe, still civilised, or so we thought.<br/><br/>Of course, Sylvania isn\'t really the Empire, even now. Oh, the Emperor may claim it as his own, but ever since the Wars of the Vampire Counts and maybe even before, the common people have known that they were better off begging the local von Carstein vampire for mercy than expecting any protection from the Empire. That was what we realised as we rode and hiked through the villages—that we were the outsiders here, we were the foreigners, even more than when we\'d campaigned in Tilea or Norsca. People were wary of helping us because their Undead masters might call them traitors.<br/><br/>We found von Bierstein\'s manor house on the afternoon of the fourth day, a grim and desolate building set atop an equally forbidding hill in the centre of a wasteland. The village beneath it was dark and stinking, half-deserted\; we could hear doors being barred as we came through, and we knew we\'d get no succour there. This manor house was fortified, but it wasn\'t what you would call a castle\; we knew there would be no need to besiege it, just attack from all sides and there was no way the garrison would be big enough to stop us all from getting over the walls. We figured we could negotiate for the girl\'s release, because von Bierstein must have known it too.<br/><br/>That was the plan. Von Bierstein didn\'t co-operate though. One of his servants said he wouldn\'t come out to even parlay until sundown. We thought he was just delaying the inevitable, trying to come up with a scheme of his own that might stop us doing what we came to do. We were wrong. I should have seen the signs by then, and part of me had done—but you like to tell yourself you\'re above the fireside yarns and soldiers\' tales, that it would be paranoia to see Vampires everywhere just because you were in Sylvania. I had convinced myself this would be an easy job.<br/><br/>When he finally came out to talk to us, he had a counter-proposal of his own. He was one of the von Carstein vampires, he told us\; his knights waited at his back, silent and malevolent. He raised his hand and the earth erupted outside the manor house, Zombies and Skeletons spewing forth from shallow graves. His knights raised their swords, and a cold grey glint in their eyes told me they were Wights. There was no way we could fight and win here, not without losing half our men or more. The Vampire told us we had till the following sundown to get out of Sylvania, or he would personally hunt us down—along with all the other von Carstein he could contact, and all their armies and minions. Then he brought the girl out. She smiled, and I saw the size of her canines, the pallid skin, and the red glow to her eyes\; she was one of them now, and she said she would look forward to joining the hunt.<br/><br/>That decided us. No way the merchant would pay us any bonus for bringing that thing back home to Daddy. We marched all night and all day. Old Boris twisted his ankle, and the lads were all for leaving him to fend for himself—he had his dagger out and was about to slit his own throat so the Vampires couldn\'t take him. I gave him my own horse. I won\'t see one of my men die without reason. The archers were loosing at shadows by the time we crossed the border back into the rest of Stirland, but we made it. I still don\'t know if von Bierstein really would have hunted us down, but I had no wish to find out.";

The 40 teams are grouped into their two conferences and eight divisions, but they can play any other NAF team during the season. So long as they complete exactly 16 fixtures (by complete we just mean arrange... at least twenty games a season are forfeited when one team doesn\'t turn up), each team can play anyone it likes so long as it plays each team in its division at least once (that\'s each other team, Hobgoblin fans!) and doesn\'t play any team more than twice. Actually this rule is often waived. As the Dwarf Giants would put it, \"when we get to them for the third time, they ain\'t the same team\".<br/>Fixtures are organised at a pre-season meeting of the owners. Each brings 16 team socks (or other apparel, in the case of Halflings) to be exchanged for the other teams socks in a frantic meeting. As you might expect, ambitious teams try to arrange a fixture schedule against the weakest opponents possible, which makes the Hobgoblin Team, the Rats and the three Halfling teams very popular. Another consideration is the attractiveness of the opposition; a game agains the Cowboys always draws the fans! Bribes, violence and magic are used to influence the swapping of these socks, and the meeting often lasts for several days until any manager can leave with his sixteen opponents mapped out.<br/>After years of receiving weighty bribes (some of which couldn\'t be eaten), last season the Stunted Stoutfellows managed to get themselves a fixture list which included three games against the Hobgoblin Team, two against the Scarcrag Snivellers and one against the Rats.
